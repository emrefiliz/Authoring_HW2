This homework helps to figure out how to work using socket.io
I learned how to use libraries to my app by using these libraries.
I also used SCSS and dicreased the css size. 
I used dark and lime colours combination on my app.
I added some features to my app as converting nicknames initals Caps and giving message timing.
My first light-box where people can enter their nicknames fades out with my slow feature. It looks much better then default.
